            <p>
                The 1986 EDSA revolution marked the founding of Palayan City High School during the over threw of Marcos from his throne. Former City Mayor and Congressman Pacifico M. Fajardo was very passionate then with the thought of starting an institution that could serve indigent but deserving students who could not afford to go to private schools and the schools in Cabanatuan City.

          In the beginning, the school occupied four (4) classroom building which was owned by Sabani Estate Agricultural College (SEAC). Mr. Julio Velarde was assigned as its first Officer-in-Charge. Only 162 students enrolled for first and second year. The school realized its success through the sacrifices and perseverance of the six pioneer teachers. 

            The school was newly nationalized in 1988 under the administration of Mrs. Teodora P. Gines , Palayan City District Supervisor I and PCHS Officer-in-Charge. After Mrs. Gines, Mr. Julian R. Pangilinan was assigned for a year (1988-1989) and Mrs. Maria G. Fajardo followed (1989-1993). In 1993-1995, Dr. Manuel G. Nicolas, Education Supervisor I, assumed the responsibility as Officer-in-Charge. It was during his term that the school got its remarkable change. Several buildings were constructed and permanent teachers completed the teaching force. There were instructional materials requested from the Mt. Pinatubo Commission 

From 1995 to 2002, the school was under the supervision of Mrs. Estelita R.Cruz. During her time, the school made a lot of accomplishments in physical and academic aspects. Due to increase in population the position of Mrs. Estelita R. Cruz was reclassified as Principal II. In the year 2002, Miss Concepcion R. Quebral took her post as principal of the school. It was during her term that the PCHS Gymnasium was constructed from the CDF of Congressman Aurelio M. Umali. Then Mrs. Estelita R. Cruz returned in 2004-2006. Upon her promotion as Principal-III on August 15, 2006 she was succeeded by Dr. Eva Fe F. Taclibon. The school was under the leadership of Dr. Taclibon for one and half year. She has brought changes in the school environment and in the relationship of teachers, students and even the people in the community.</p>
